# JavaScript Projects
This repository contains various **JavaScript projects** that I created as part of my learning process in the Harvardx CS50 course. The projects demonstrate various functionalities such as color changing, counters, and task management.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Colors.html**:
   - A simple project that changes the background color of the page dynamically.
   - Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
   - The page randomly changes colors when a button is clicked, demonstrating the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

### 2. **Counter.html**:
   - Create a counter that can be incremented and decremented by the user.
   - Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
   - This project features a counter that can be increased or decreased based on user interaction with buttons. It uses JavaScript to track and update the count.

### 3. **Counter.js**:
   - A more advanced version of the basic counter project.
   - Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
   - This version of the counter uses JavaScript to store the counter value and allows the user to reset the counter, demonstrating the use of event listeners and state management.

### 4. **Hello**.html:
   - A fun interactive project that displays a "hell" message.
   - Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
   - This project displays a playful "hello" message and changes dynamically based on user interaction, showcasing basic JavaScript operations and event handling.

### 5. **Tasks**:
   - Create a simple task management app.
   - Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
   - This project lets the user add tasks to a list, marking them as completed, and removing them. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript for handling form inputs, list items, and DOM updates.
